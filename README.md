# MarA-Halflife-2018
The accompanying code and data necessary to reproduce the figures from "Active degradation of MarA controls coordination of its downstream targets" by Nicholas A. Rossi, Thierry Mora, Aleksandra M. Walczak and Mary J. Dunlop

This code is in three parts. The analytical sections of figures 2, 3 and 4 are executed by **analytic_driver.py**. The Experimental sections of figure 2 are produced from **crispr_driver.py** and the experimental sections of figure 3 are produced from **modified_marA_driver.py**.
